**AI Cat Project Plan**
Main Goal

Before summer ends, get an AI trained on cat data to control the OpenCat, Nybble. The AI will need to process visual and audio data.

**Goal 1: Direct Control via Serial Interface**

Objective: Tell Nybble what to do directly from the code, using the serial interface. It will perform a preprogrammed action.

Steps:

Learn the Serial Interface:

Study the communication protocol used by Nybble.
Review documentation and examples provided by OpenCat/Nybble.
Find and Modify the Right File:

Locate the code file responsible for controlling Nybble’s actions.
Modify the code to include a simple preprogrammed action (e.g., waving a paw).
Update Nybble with New Code:

Upload the modified code to Nybble.
Test the new functionality to ensure it performs as expected.
**Goal 2: Train AI for Audio and Visual Processing**

Objective: Find and train an AI that can process audio and visual data. Start with simple audio commands, like walking a few steps when it hears a clap.

Steps:

Find the Right AI:

Research available AI frameworks suitable for audio and visual data processing (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Choose a framework based on ease of use, community support, and compatibility.
Get the Webcam Working:

Connect and configure a webcam to the computer.
Write code to capture and display video feed using the chosen AI framework.
Train the AI on Audio Commands:

Collect a dataset of audio commands (e.g., clapping sounds).
Train the AI to recognize these commands and map them to specific actions.
Test the AI's accuracy in recognizing the commands.
Run AI on Computer and Connect to Cat:

Implement a Bluetooth communication module to send commands from the computer to Nybble.
Ensure reliable data transfer between the AI and Nybble.
**Goal 3: Integrate Visual Processing**

Objective: Enable Nybble to recognize and react to visual cues, like following a moving object or identifying a person.

Steps:

Collect Visual Data:

Record videos or take pictures of the objects/cues Nybble needs to recognize.
Annotate the data for training purposes.
Train the AI on Visual Data:

Use the annotated data to train a computer vision model.
Test the model's ability to recognize and track objects.
Integrate Visual Processing with Nybble:

Modify the AI to send appropriate commands to Nybble based on visual input.
Ensure Nybble can respond in real-time to visual stimuli.
**Goal 4: Create Realistic Cat-like Behavior**

Objective: Program Nybble to exhibit realistic cat-like behaviors, using the AI to simulate actions such as purring, meowing, and interacting with its environment.

Steps:

Behavioral Analysis:

Study and document typical cat behaviors and the conditions that trigger them.
Identify key behaviors to simulate with Nybble.
AI Behavioral Control:

Develop AI algorithms that mimic cat-like behaviors based on sensory input (audio and visual).
Implement these behaviors as part of Nybble's action repertoire.
Testing and Refinement:

Continuously test and refine Nybble’s behaviors to enhance realism.
Gather feedback and make adjustments as necessary.
**Goal 5: Deploy AI on Embedded System**

Objective: Transition the AI from running on a computer to an embedded system onboard Nybble for greater autonomy.

Steps:

Select Embedded Hardware:

Research suitable embedded systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson).
Choose hardware that meets processing and power requirements.
Port AI to Embedded System:

Adapt the AI code to run on the selected embedded hardware.
Optimize performance to ensure real-time processing.
Integrate with Nybble:

Connect the embedded system to Nybble’s control board.
Ensure seamless communication and control.
Field Testing:

Conduct extensive field tests to verify the autonomous operation.
Make necessary adjustments based on test results.
